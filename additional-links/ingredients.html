            Summary
            These ingredients work synergistically to create a stable, effective product that moisturizes and conditions
            the skin while facilitating hair removal (due to the depilatory action of Potassium Thioglycolate and the pH
            adjustment by Calcium Hydroxide). Emollients like Mineral Oil and Cetearyl Alcohol ensure the skin remains
            hydrated and smooth. Preservatives like Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Benzoate maintain the product's safety
            and efficacy over time, while humectants like Glycerin attract moisture, keeping the skin soft and supple.
