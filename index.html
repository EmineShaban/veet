        <h2 class="title">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF USING DEPILATORY CREAMS
        </h2>
        <p>In the culture we live in, the beauty industry is always looking for the easiest and most effective way to
            keep unwanted body hair at bay. Despite all the options out there, many women will say that depilatory
            creams are the only way. They offer an easy and pain-free way to remove hair from almost all areas of your
            body. Here’s some insight into how depilatory creams have revolutionized hair removal, and why they might
            just be the ideal choice for you.
            <br>
            <br>

            <b> How do they work?
            </b>
            <br>
            Depilatory creams contain certain alkaline chemicals that safely react with the hair on your body. They
            break down the Keratin (the protein structure of your hair), causing it to weaken and dissolve. This
            leaves the hair in a jelly-like state which the user can easily wipe away with the cream.

            <br>
            <br>

            <b> The Ups and Downs
            </b> <br>
            Depilatory creams are one of the most painless ways to remove body hair especially when compared to waxing
            or shaving. They are a great all-around method for getting rid of both large areas of hairs along your legs,
            but also great for tackling smaller, harder-to-reach areas like ones around the bikini line. And Veet® make
            it very easy to apply! Simply spread the cream over a patch of hair and wait a few minutes before removing
            it (be sure to read the label to see what the specific recommended times are). In that time you could be
            getting on with all sorts of other things, from brushing your teeth to starting up a bath.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="text">
            Using depilatory creams in the shower is a great option as it can make the process virtually mess-free! The
            cream washes off, along with the hair, and simply rinses down the drain. Veet® has a specific foam range
            designed just for use in the shower which will stay on while you wash, and can be rinsed off when you’re
            ready. If you don’t have access to a shower or a bath, you can always use a regular cream which can be
            removed with a spatula, but you should still be sure to rinse thoroughly afterwards, using a warm, wet
            cloth.
            <br>
            Available in all good cosmetic stores, depilatory creams can be a great affordable option compared to going
            to the salon, and therefore can be much easier to fit into your budget. As well as that, there is no risk of
            encountering the kind of cuts and nicks that you might get from shaving. Depilatory products also give a
            longer lasting result than shaving, as they are able to slowly break down the hair at or just below the
            skin's surface, right at the follicle. You might also find that the regrowth of the hair will not be as
            stubbly as that produced when shaving as the tips have been tapered, and appear softer and less noticeable.
            <br>
            If you have sensitive skin, however, you may be concerned about a reaction irritation. Fortunately, Veet®
            has a whole range aimed specifically at sensitive skin, enriched with Aloe Vera and Vitamin E, known for
            their soothing properties. However, to be sure, we recommend carrying out a patch test at least 24 hours
            before applying the cream to check that it doesn’t cause a reaction. If you do react to the cream, then you
            know that this might not be the method for you. Always remember, it’s never a good idea to use your cream
            over areas of broken or irritated skin.
            <br>
            If you’re considering trying out depilatory creams, be sure to check out the extensive range from Veet®.

                    You can use the product as often as needed, but it is recommended to wait at least 72 hours between
                    applications to prevent skin irritation.

                    Perform a patch test by applying a small amount of cream to a small area of your skin that you wish
                    to treat. Wait 24 hours to see if any irritation occurs. If no adverse reaction is observed, you can
                    proceed with full application.
